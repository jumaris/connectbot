Here are some keyboard shortcuts available when a **hardware keyboard** is present. If you're using a phone where the main input type is a **virtual keyboard**, please see UsageWithSoftKeyboard.

**Note:** the side that **shift**, **alt**, **slash**, and **tab** uses can be changed in preferences between left, right, and disabled.

  * Control key (CTRL)
> > Pressing once on the trackball will toggle on **control** for the next character typed. The cursor will indicate this state with a < symbol. Note that pressing the trackball again will send an **escape** key.

  * Escape (ESC)
> > Pressing twice on the trackball will send **escape** key. Note that some other terminal emulators map pressing **ALT-_key_** to **escape + _key_**.

  * Shift
> > Pressing the **shift** (up arrow) key once will make the next key typed its uppercase variant according to the keyboard layout. This state is indicated with an outline of a triangle on the top of the cursor. Pressing it twice will turn on **shift lock** which is indicated by a solid triangle on the top of the cursor.

  * Alt
> > Pressing the **Alt** key once will make the next key typed its symbol as indicated on the keyboard. This state is indicated with the outline of a triangle on the bottom of the cursor. Pressing it twice will turn on **alt lock** which is indicated by a solid triangle on the bottom of the cursor.

  * Slash (opposite side Alt)
> > The opposite side **alt** key can be used as a shortcut for the forward slash / character. This aids in quickly typing directories on the G1.

  * Tab (opposite side Shift)
> > The opposite side **shift** key can be used as a shortcut for the **tab** key (CTRL-i) for quick completion in many shells.

  * Function keys (F1 through F10)
> > Hold down the shift key and press numbers 1 through 10 to send F1 through F10 respectively.
